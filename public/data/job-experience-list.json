They are putting their experience to work to maximize cloud-based content management, whether it be asset management for individual clients or the distribution of some of the most popular television shows in the world. Syncro deals with a lot of stuff, and if I recall correctly, YouTube did not exist at the time. They were delivering their content in an old-fashioned manner by mailing out a large number of DVDs and other items. So, once again, we envisioned a centralized website where clients could immediately upload and browse their media. Switching to 100% digitally stored media significantly reduced distribution expenses. Not only that, but the central website made cooperation and brainstorming on new ideas easier and virtually instantaneous. Back then, we employed cutting-edge technology, ASP.NET 2.0, in conjunction with Microsoft's Silverlight to create engaging, dynamic user experiences for Web and mobile applications. This approach enabled us to build a website that was both cost-effective and user-friendly. We were able to quickly respond to customer feedback and evolve our product. The website was a great success, and we were able to expand our customer base significantly.",

I was hired as a web consultant to assist in the implementation of a more centralized and database-driven content management system. So that multiple editors with varying levels of access might simply modify their guidelines from a single central database. I created the main website as well as the CMS, which would automatically sync with the most recent modifications. This would allow a traveling editor to simply contribute, add, or amend any landmark, restaurant, bar, or store that would subsequently appear in the guide's final book version. We even tried implementing automatic page layout in InDesign by linking it straight to the central database. The CMS also allowed for the automatic generation of an interactive map with hotspots and interactive tooltips, allowing for a more interactive user experience. We also implemented a search feature, allowing users to quickly find any landmark, restaurant, bar, or store within the guide.",

He was originally from Taiwan, was really interested in technology and e-commerce, and had this brilliant idea to sell items for professional dancers online. How could you possibly sell shoes online if clients could not physically try them on? Professional dancing, on the other hand, is a nice and specific niche where dancers know exactly what they need and order their shoes frequently before every major competition. Those shoes take a lot of abuse and must be updated frequently. So, since I already had some expertise with ASP.NET and C#, I decided to assist him in realizing his vision. We took inspiration from other websites on the Internet and created an e-commerce website from the ground up, including the SQL Server database for the back end and VeriSign for credit card processing. We also implemented a content management system for updating the products, and an analytics system for tracking user behavior. The website was launched on time and was well-received by the customers.",
