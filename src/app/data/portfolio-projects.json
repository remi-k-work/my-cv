    "txt": "NoLine-Deli Manager is a bespoke content management system (CMS) that I built to run NoLine-Deli, a fictitious organic European food store I made as a personal e-commerce venture. This user-friendly platform enables anyone to experiment with managing the backend of an online store. Users can create, update, and delete brands, categories, subcategories, and goods, gaining firsthand experience with e-commerce content management. Seamless image management assures a visually beautiful storefront, and the system's connection with the NoLine-Deli front-end (which I also designed) ensures smooth data flow and real-time updates.",

We will deliver goods directly to your home. We also have another goal besides making it convenient for you. We want to introduce fresh, healthy, organic, and high-quality European products to you, no matter which part of the United States you are located in. If you have Central European roots or happen to visit here, we want to bring you some of your favorite foods and memories and make you feel like you are in your hometown. We treat each client individually. In our offer, you will find products that are specific to Poland, famous for sausage, pierogis, kielbasa, and kiszka. However, we constantly expand our merchandise and are open to your suggestions. Our organic healthy food store has a goal to deliver any item you ask for from the variety we have to offer: breads, coffees, desserts, baking, dry goods, sauces, snacks, soups, spices, sweets, teas, and more. In case you have individual needs that go beyond the list of our items, please let us know, and we will try to find them for you. If you are creating a party and need some advice about the menu, we might help as well.",

I really enjoy React since it allows you to think more modularly when creating your app and also aids in encapsulation. I am practicing with React Router, which is another useful tool for making React's SPA behave more like a traditional website with discrete pages and routes. I went through one of the tutorials on Coding in Public. So, starting now, take charge of your spending, especially during the holiday season!",
