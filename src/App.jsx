  intro:
    "I am a self-taught web developer with over 5 years of experience in building and maintaining websites. I have a strong foundation in ASP.NET and C#, but I am also eager to learn new technologies and frameworks. I took a long break from the industry to focus on other pursuits, but I am now passionate about returning to web development. I am particularly interested in internship opportunities where I can learn from experienced professionals and contribute to a team. Even though I had a long break, I am confident that I can quickly get back up to speed on the latest technologies and trends. I am a hard worker, and I am always willing to go the extra mile. I am also a team player, and I am eager to learn new things. I am confident that I can be a valuable asset to any company that is willing to give me a chance.",

While I do not have a formal degree in computer science, I have a strong foundation in the fundamentals of the subject. I am also proficient in a variety of programming languages and technologies, including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and React. I am a hard worker, and I am always willing to go the extra mile.
